#**Nisreen's Summer Goals**

While working on both the ECHO project and processing my thesis (bokashi) data, I aim to:
- Gain proficiency in laboratory skills related to microbial analyses
- Develop computer programming/coding skills
- Practice various forms of science writing (scientific, academic, and general public audiences)

As a member of the VKC lab, I hope to:
- Help organize VKC lab outreach material: website, instagram, blog
- Observe collaborative research environments
- Reflect on a potential career in microbiology
